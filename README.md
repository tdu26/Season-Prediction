An intuitive hypothesis : Peopleâ€™s tastes and feelings change from seasons to seasons, so people have different preferences when come to food selections in different seasons. We would like to find out if some food or drink have high correlation with sepecific season and would like to predict season given restaurant type and reviews. Thus, we are interested in:

                                           Season <= restaurant type + reviews
